// Imagine that you are a bus operator. You
//  have a fleet of buses out on the road, and
//  you know the location of each bus. At the
//  end of the day, each bus needs to return to
//  a garage for the night. You manage
//  multiple garages, at a number of different
//  locations. We want to tell each bus which
//  garage it should drive to for the night,
//  minimizing the total distance traveled by
//  all buses.
//  Please write some code that assigns each
//  bus to a garage. Show that your solution
//  works correctly with a few test cases.


// ZONEs to simplify picking

// Mutliple buses --> know location --> Zones (Central)

// Then delve into API
